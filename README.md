Typical Hello World repository

Well this is my first time using Github, surely is better than Perforce.

I'm a Software Engineer that likes to code and solve problems but hate meetings, specially when nothing is achieved from them.
Right now I'm trying to learn about new tochnologies and how they work, that is the reason why I'm using github and my first goal is to learn more about blockchain technology and crypto since it seems to be a very interesting subject.
